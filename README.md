# ImgurUploader
simple graphical imgur uploader, less than 2 clicks.

## Usage

You can drag one, or multiple images onto the window to upload them.
Or, you can paste image data into the window with `ctrl-v`. (for example: printscreen then ctr+v)

Copying the links is as simple as selecting the image you want to copy and pressing `ctrl+c`.  The items will be on your clipboard, if multiple were selected then they'll be separated by a newline character (`\n`). The typical `shift+click`, `ctrl+click`, etc idioms are supported.
